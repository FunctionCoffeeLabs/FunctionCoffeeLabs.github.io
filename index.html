			          		<span> We started our business in April 2015 in a very simple way: by creating an Instagram account.</span>

			          		In the beginning, this was really just us taking pictures of cool coffee shops, amazing latte art, and science-y brewing devices. We spent summer 2015 working on the financials and our business plan. In September 2015, when we returned to the USA after living in the UK (Ross for six years, Megan for one), we started scoping out potential locations. It took us until February 2016 to find the right spot. After two and a half months of blood, black fingernails, swearing, sweat, and tears, we opened for business in late April 2016. We started because we traveled to dozens of countries while living in England and ended up seeking out great coffee shops everywhere we went, not just because we are coffee lovers, but because we love everything that a coffee shop can be...
			          	</p>

						<p id="about_p">
			          		We played chess in a tiny basement bookstore/coffee shop in Bergen, Norway. We made a great connection with a small record/coffee shop owner in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We had our Eureka moment in a shop in Bath, UK where we both finally tasted all those flavors that bags of coffee promise but never really seem to deliver. We became regulars at the smallest cafe we've ever seen in Paris, France while we lived there for three weeks in April. The barista there was the epitome of cool, the coffee was great, and everyone talked to everyone else the entire time. Ross is obsessed with the technical side of always improving the quality of the coffee, and Meg is obsessed with the way in which coffee shops become hubs of community activity and people making connections.

						<h3 class="roaster"> Ceremony Coffee Roasters (Annapolis, MD) </h3>

						<p> BRAZIL ALTA MOGIANA</p>

						<p> CERRADO GOLD </p>

						<p> Tasting notes: Honey dew and brown sugar aromatics. Nutella and toast in a full, simple cup.</p>

						<p> Our 2016 Cerrado Gold presents a fresh update on a staple single origin in our offering. This lot is a clean, sweet, balanced coffee from Fazenda Nossa Senhora Aparecida in the Alta Mogiana Region. With delicious, brown descriptors aplenty and a highlight of melon, this is a comfy coffee that's as satisfying black as it is with milk.</p>

						<p> Roast: Light </p>

						<p> Body: Full </p>

						<p> Acidity: Mellow </p>

						<p> Country: Brazil Alta Mogiana </p>

						<p> Farm: Nossa Senhora Aparecida </p>

						<p> Altitude: 1000 masl </p>

						<p> Varietals: Acaia </p>

						<p> Process: Honey </p>

						<h2> Handpour and Coffee Shot </h2>

						<h3> Ceremony Coffee Roasters </h3>

						<p> RWANDA KARONGI DISTRICT </p>

						<p> KOPAKAKI </p>

						<p> Tasting notes: Honey and pomegranate aromatics. Juicy pink grapefruit in a light, zippy cup </p>

						<p> This fully washed lot comes to us from Kopakaki Cooperative in the Karongi District of Rwanda's Western Province. This collective of 1,184 smallholders brings their daily harvests to the shared washing station, where coffees undergo two days of dry fermentation, a twenty-four hour soak, and then move to raised beds to dry. Kopakaki has been one of the top producers of specialty in the country, and this lot is a clean, fruit-forward representation of that fact. </p>

						<p> Roast: Light </p>

						<p> Body: Medium </p>

						<p> Acidity: Citrusy </p>

						<p> Country: Rwanda Karongi District </p>

						<p> Altitude: 1500-1800 masl </p>

						<p> Varietals: Bourbon </p>

						<p> Process: Fully Washed </p>

						<h3> Case Coffee Roasters (Ashland, OR) </h3>

						<p> Producer: Ermenegildo Insuasty </p>

						<p> Region: Narino </p>

						<p> Elevation: 1900 - 2030 Masl </p>

						<p> Varietal: 100% Caturra </p>

						<p> Harvest: July 2015 </p>

						<p> Tasting notes: Papaya, guava, mango </p>

						<h2> Decaf </h2>
						<p> <i> (available as any espresso-based drink) </i></p>

						<h3 class="roaster"> Ceremony Coffee Roasters </h3>

						<p> Decaf Colombia Huila </p>

						<p> Tasting notes: Cherry cola aromatics. Subtle plum acidity in a clean, sweet cup. </p>

						<p> Decaf House is a washed lot of mixed varieties. This lot was selected for EA decaffeination in Colombia because of its clean, sweet cup profile. The ethyl acetate (ethyl alcohol + acetic acid) used in this process is an organic compound derived from fermented sugar cane. This compound is an effective, natural solvent for caffeine extraction, leaving the coffee's cup characteristics fairly well intact. EA is also the most prevalent ester found in beer and wine. </p>

						<p> Roast: Light </p>

						<p> Body: Medium </p>

						<p> Country: Colombia </p>

						<p> Altitude: 1300-1600 masl </p>

						<p> Process: Washed </p>
